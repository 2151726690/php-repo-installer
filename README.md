###About this repo
This is web installer file that allows you to easily install any given GitHub repo. It uses pure PHP and it doesn't require you to install GIT on your server, enable PHP shell access or anything extra.

###How to use it
1. Download and edit the `$settings` array that you will find at the beginning of the file.
2. Upload this file to your target destination.
3. Open your website target destination URL and follow up the install process.

By default this installs [Chevereto/Chevereto-Free](https://github.com/Chevereto/Chevereto-Free) but the file includes examples to install Drupal, WordPress, PrestaShop, etc. It can be used to install any public GitHub repo.

###Why?
I wanted a hassle free universal PHP alternative for those that wanted to install Chevereto-Free so I figured out that a web installer should be perfect for this. Is all made using standard libraries so it doesn't require anything fancy.
